1. Consider the following two classes:

      public class ClassA {

        }
        public void methodTwo(int i) {
        }
        public static void methodThree(int i) {
        }
        public static void methodFour(int i) {
        }
      }

      public class ClassB extends ClassA {
        public static void methodOne(int i) {
        }
        public void methodTwo(int i) {
        }
        public void methodThree(int i) {
        }
        public static void methodFour(int i) {
        }
